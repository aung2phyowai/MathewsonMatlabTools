function [B]=BOSC_tf_3(eegsignal,F,Fsample,wavenumber)% [B,T,P]=BOSC_tf(eegsignal,F,Fsample,wavenumber,conv_flag);%% This function computes a continuous wavelet (Morlet) transform on% a segment of EEG signal; this can be used to estimate the% background spectrum (BOSC_bgfit) or to apply the BOSC method to% detect oscillatory episodes in signal of interest (BOSC_detect).% this version has option uses frequency domain convolution unless you ask% it not to%% parameters:% eegsignal - a row vector containing a segment of EEG signal to be%             transformed% F - a set of frequencies to sample (Hz)% Fsample - sampling rate of the time-domain signal (Hz)% wavenumber is the size of the wavelet (typically, width=6)% conv_flag - optional argument, is 1 if you want matlab conv.m, leave out% for faster fft convolution - KEM 2016%	% returns:% B - time-frequency spectrogram: power as a function of frequency%     (rows) and time (columns)% T - vector of time values (based on sampling rate, Fsample)% P - estimated phase for each point in time and for each frequency - KEM 2014% eegsignal = test;% Fsample = srate;% wavenumber = wavenum;% st=1./(2*pi*(F/wavenumber));A=1./sqrt(st*sqrt(pi));B = zeros(length(F),length(eegsignal)); % initialize the time-frequency matrix% P = B;for f=1:length(F) % loop through sampled frequencies  t=-3.6*st(f):(1/Fsample):3.6*st(f);  m=A(f)*exp(-t.^2/(2*st(f)^2)).*exp(1i*2*pi*F(f).*t); % Morlet wavelet  %   if nargin == 5 %flag for old fft version%       y=conv(eegsignal,m,'same');%   else  %use faster fft method      ms = length(m);      Ly = length(eegsignal)+ms-1;      Ly2=pow2(nextpow2(Ly));    % Find smallest power of 2 that is > combined length      X=fft(eegsignal(:), Ly2);		   % Fast Fourier transform      H=fft(m(:), Ly2);	           % Fast Fourier transform (:) to treat as column and ignore input orientation)      y=ifft(X.*H, Ly2);      % Inverse fast Fourier transform or product      y=y(1:1:Ly);               % Take just the first N elements      y = y(ceil(ms/2):end-floor(ms/2)); %cut off the ends so length of input data%   end    B(f,:) = abs(y).^2;%   if nargout == 3%       P(f,:) = angle(y);%   endend% if nargout >= 2%     T=(1:size(eegsignal,2))/Fsample;% end%    This file is part of the Better OSCillation detection (BOSC) library.%%    The BOSC library is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify%    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by%    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or%    (at your option) any later version.%%    The BOSC library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,%    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of%    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
